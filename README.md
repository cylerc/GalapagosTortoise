This GitHub repository includes data files (.csv and .txt) associated with R analyses and visualizations for the manuscript currently in reivew, titled: Stable isotope ecology and the 1850s Floreana Island Galapagos tortoise (Chelonoidis niger niger) extinction

Since this repository is currently under review, we have limited the full suite of meta-data present within this readme and associated compendium. For example, we plan to publish a detailed description of all files included if this manuscript is accepted for publication. See here for a relevant example of how this repository will eventually be structured and organized: https://github.com/cylerc/14C_Antiquity/blob/master/README.md

For now, all data is located within the "data" folder, and all R code is located within the "analyses" folder. This provides the ability to reproduce all metric, statistical, and visual actions we took to complete this manuscript. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any issues or questions accessing these files:
